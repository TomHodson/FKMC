## October 1

 Having issues with the IPR again so the plan action for this is:
 
 1) solve a slightly dirty (5%ish) CDW model for a range of temperatures
 2) bin the IPRs at a range of bin densities 
 3) Apply interpolation and replot
 
 Looking to see if the scaling of the IPR is visible in these plots

 4) Solve the dirty IPR model for defect density ranging from 0 to 1
 5) plot this in the same stle as the gap opening plots
