order of operations:

submit.py:

1) chooses a name for the job
2) converts the ipynb file to a py file
3) 


Todo:
- submit a first job script of a temperature sweep
- modify batch_params to include an indices argument (maybe as a string for full control?) and use that in submission
- Add the ability to depend on previous job ids
- add a way to submit multiple jobs at the same time
- maybe make this a separte submit script?
